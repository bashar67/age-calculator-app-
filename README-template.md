## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

That's a great project, Bashar! Here’s a summary of what you likely learned from creating it:

1. **HTML Structure**:

   - Understanding how to structure a webpage using semantic HTML tags like `<input>`, `<button>`, and `<div>`.
   - Creating forms or inputs for users to interact with (e.g., entering their birthdate).

2. **CSS Styling**:

   - Using CSS to enhance the visual design of your page. This may include styling buttons, aligning elements, or defining layout through properties like `flexbox` or `grid`.
   - Learning to create a user-friendly interface that looks clean and functional.

3. **JavaScript for Interactivity**:

   - Grasping how to write functions to calculate the age based on the user’s input.
   - Handling events like button clicks (`addEventListener` or inline event handling).
   - Validating user input to ensure it’s in the correct format before performing calculations.
   - Manipulating the DOM to display the calculated age dynamically.

4. **Integration of Technologies**:

   - Combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a cohesive project, learning how these three technologies work together to create interactive webpages.

5. **Logical Thinking**:

   - Practicing problem-solving skills while working out the logic for age calculation (e.g., handling edge cases like leap years or invalid dates).

6. **Project Workflow**:
   - Gaining hands-on experience with writing and organizing code. also learned the importance of debugging and testing your code for errors.
